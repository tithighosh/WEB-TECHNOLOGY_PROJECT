              Tools Used:</h3>
<h5>

• Editor (Sublime Text)
<br>
• XAMPP Control Panel
<br>
• GitHub
<br>

<h3>Impact of this Project:</h3>
beneficiary works like pollution control, give medicine to the poor and needy, save street animals etc. They 
can easily accomplish their works if a good and well-established crowdfunding website can be developed 
and found. This will have a great impact on our society as well as our environment. Again, this startup can 
make more successful organizations and will contribute to change our society and environment by their 
future works.
<h3>Limitations and Possible Future Improvements:</h3>
Our application has some limitation like if there is any donor or project initiator who has bad intentions,
can’t be verified by us. Beside, we cannot verify if the project money is properly used or not. If donors do 
not feel interest to donate, time of other users will be wasted. After getting complains, we will block the 
user. However, we cannot take any action on them. It is in our plan to add the features and add the 
harassment sector in it.
