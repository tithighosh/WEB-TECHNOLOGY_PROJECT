It’s the basis for helping your staff be effective ambassadors in the larger community.<br><br>

An inspiring mission helps communicate the impact of your efforts and drives action within your team and community.<br><br>
And finally, a strong brand creates an identity for your platform and helps wrap your vision and mission into a tangible thing people can experience, talk about, and love.<br><br><br>

Vision statements are future-based and are meant to inspire and give direction to your team and culture rather than to donors. They are meant to synthesize your ambition while mobilizing your staff to be effective ambassadors for the long-term goals.

Determine who will play a role in crafting the vision. Host a workshop or conduct interviews with key stakeholders who represent a cross-section of your organization/community and answer the following questions:<br><br>

1.What are the core values of your organization/community?<br>
2.What do you do now that aligns with these values? Where are you not aligned with these values?<br>
3.What problems do you hope to solve/what do you hope to achieve in the next few years?<br>
4.Who does your team serve and what do you want to do for them?<br>
5.What will success look like if you accomplish all of
 these things?<br>
 Once you’ve collected all the answers, make a plan to communicate your vision statement and commit time and resources to realize it.
